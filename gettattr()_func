Help on built-in function getattr in module builtins:

getattr(...)
    getattr(object, name[, default]) -> value
    
    Get a named attribute from an object; getattr(x, 'y') is equivalent to x.y.
    When a default argument is given, it is returned when the attribute doesn't
    exist; without it, an exception is raised in that case.
